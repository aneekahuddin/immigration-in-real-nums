# Incarceration in Real Numbers

## About

[Immigration in real numbers](https://aneekahuddin.github.io/immigration-in-real-nums) is a data visualization project by [Aneekah Uddin](https://aneekahuddin.github.io/). It was born out of the [Princeton Ida B. Wells Just Data Lab](https://www.thejustdatalab.com/). It launched in Summer/Fall 2022.

This code was forked from and adapted to address a different social issue than the original data visualization. The original, [Incarceration in real numbers](https://mkorostoff.github.io/incarceration-in-real-numbers) is a data visualization project by [Matt Korostoff](https://mkorostoff.github.io/). It is not affiliated with or sponsored by any organization. It launched in autumn 2020.
