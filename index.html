If the US can spend $125.06 every day to detain a single adult, can they provide access to health care for COVID-19?

        <p>Imagine how different our society would be if we took this route. Everyone would win! There would be fewer crime victims, fewer lives ruined by incarceration, lower taxes, and less risk to police. But our political climate has made this completely reasonable approach virtually unthinkable.</p>

        <p>Is it really so radical to suggest that we can do better?</p>

        <p>Our leaders will blather on about the burden these programs put on "taxpayers" but they don't actually care about that, they only care that the solution feels sufficiently punitive. This pointless refusal to implement workable policies has been a catastrophe for society, directly costing billions to taxpayers and sucking literally <em>trillions</em> out of the economy in lost productivity and excess crime [<a class="citation" href="https://github.com/MKorostoff/incarceration-in-real-numbers/blob/master/SOURCES.md#cost-of-incarceration" target="_blank">(citation)</a>].</p>

        <p>It's tempting to think of incarceration as something that happens to abstract, far-away strangers, but that is wrong. It could happen to you.</p>

        <p>In 2006 then 17 year old George Alvarez was arrested for being drunk in public. While awaiting his court date, guards beat him, and then falsely claimed self defense to explain his injuries. Threatened with 10 years in prison for an assault he did not commit, he plead guilty and served 4 years before video evidence exonerated him. All because he was drunk in public <em>one time</em>. [<a class="citation" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MKorostoff/incarceration-in-real-numbers/blob/master/SOURCES.md#wrongful-conviction-of-george-alvarez"></a>]</p>

        <p>Have you ever been drunk in public? Have you ever been in a physical fight with a family member? [<a class="citation" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MKorostoff/incarceration-in-real-numbers/blob/master/SOURCES.md#detention-of-lavette-mayes"></a>] Have you ever forgotten to pay a speeding ticket? [<a class="citation" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MKorostoff/incarceration-in-real-numbers/blob/master/SOURCES.md#fines-resulting-in-incarceration"></a>]</p>

        <p>Even a very short period of incarceration can be massively destabilizing. Think for one moment what would happen if you were jailed for sixty days, starting today. Would you still have a job when you came out? Would you have a home? Who would take care of your kids? Who would feed your dog?</p>

        <p>It doesn't have to be this way. We can have a sane prison policy without compromising public safety. We could house every homeless person. We could treat every addict. Educate every child. Meet the needs of every person driven to theft by the cost of food, shelter, and healthcare. But we <em>don't</em>.</p>

        <p>Instead, we wage war on the poor, the sick, and the addicted. We drive the homeless from their camps with guns and batons. We leave abused women and children to be crushed at the hands of their tormentors. Our government's only strategy to deal with the sick and the poor is to punish them and keep punishing them until they magically stop being sick and poor. It isn't working.</p>

        <p>There is no human development goal beyond our reach. We could build a society that is more just, more peaceful, and more prosperous than any that has ever existed on the planet. Millions could be freed from cages, and millions more could be freed from the burden of crime.</p>

        <p>Push away the cynical voice inside yourself that says this can't be done. Forget the lifetime of politicians claiming that you need to be caged; that freeing you would lead to chaos; that your poverty is a moral failing; that your pain is deserved; that your needs cannot be met. You know in your heart it isn't true.</p>

        <p>You know in your heart that this society could be ours. All we need to do is make it.</p>
